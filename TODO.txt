The core functionality for the initial phase of your payment recovery system is complete, 
but there are some important aspects we should implement to make it more robust and truly aligned with your project goals:

Smart Retry Timing

We have basic timezone awareness, but we need to fully implement the quiet hours logic to prevent late-night messages
Add business hour detection based on customer timezone


Customer Segmentation

Add logic to categorize transactions by value (high, medium, low)
Implement different recovery strategies based on segment


Multi-channel Logic

We've set up the structure for multiple channels, but need logic to determine which channel to use first
Implement fallback logic if primary channel fails


WhatsApp Integration

Create the WhatsApp service class with proper API integration


Real Payment Processing

Replace the simulated payment processing with actual NMI API integration
Add proper error handling for payment failures


Enhanced Tracking

Improve the tracking mechanism to handle events like email bounces
Track which specific messages lead to successful recovery


Security Enhancements

Add proper authentication for admin access
Implement more secure token generation and validation


Better Error Handling

Add comprehensive logging
Implement proper exception handling throughout the system



I'd suggest working through these items progressively, starting with the most essential ones for your business needs. 
Would you like me to implement any specific one of these features next?
