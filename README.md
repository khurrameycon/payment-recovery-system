# Payment Recovery System

# Phase 1: Core System Setup (PHP + MySQL)
## NMI Integration

Develop PHP scripts for NMI API interaction
Set up scheduled data fetching for failed transactions
Extract customer data (email, phone, transaction details)

## Database Architecture

Design MySQL schema with timezone data fields for customers
Create transaction value categorization fields
Implement tables for multi-channel communication tracking

## Basic Recovery Flow

Set up simple payment link generation
Create initial email and SMS reminder templates
Establish tracking mechanisms for all communications

# Phase 2: Smart Communication System
## Timezone Intelligence

Implement timezone detection and storage for customers
Create business hours configuration by region
Develop scheduling logic to respect customer timezones

## Quiet Hours Framework

Define configurable quiet periods by region/country
Build override rules for urgent high-value transactions
Implement calendar awareness (holidays, weekends)

## Customer Segmentation Engine

Develop algorithms for categorizing transactions by value
Create history-based segmentation (first-time vs. repeat customers)
Build product/service type categorization

# Phase 3: Multi-channel & Customization
## WhatsApp Integration

Set up WhatsApp Business API connection
Create WhatsApp message templates for approval
Build tracking system for WhatsApp message delivery and reads

## Channel Orchestration

Develop logic for selecting optimal communication channels
Create fallback sequences if primary channel fails
Implement cross-channel coordination (don't overwhelm customers)

## Message Customization

Create segmented message templates by customer category
Develop dynamic content insertion based on transaction type
Build A/B testing framework for message effectiveness

# Phase 4: Advanced Recovery Features
## Priority Recovery System

Implement prioritization for high-value transactions
Create VIP customer handling rules
Develop escalation paths for high-priority recovery attempts

## Analytics & Optimization

Build dashboard for recovery metrics by segment and channel
Create reporting on optimal times and channels
Implement continuous improvement framework

## Payment Alternatives

Add support for offering alternative payment methods
Implement dynamic payment options based on failure reason
Create simplified payment flows for mobile devices

# Phase 5: Expansion & Integration
## Additional Payment Gateways

Create abstraction layer for payment processors
Add support for other popular gateways
Implement unified reporting across all gateways

## Integration Capabilities

Build API endpoints for integration with other systems
Create webhooks for real-time event notifications
Develop export capabilities for external reporting

## Advanced Optimization

Implement machine learning for optimal message timing
Create predictive models for recovery likelihood
Build recommendation engine for recovery strategies


This revised plan incorporates the smart retry timing, customer segmentation, and multi-channel approach as core components rather than add-ons, ensuring they're deeply integrated into the system's architecture from the beginning.
